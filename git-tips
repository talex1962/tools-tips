* if 'git pull' fails from GitHub, try 'git pull origin master'
  (The error is usually something like "You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
   want to merge with, ...")

* to avoid having to type 'git pull origin master' every time:

    git push -u origin master

  Now 'git pull' will work.

* instead of 'git commit' use 'git commit -a -m "message"' which will cause all changes staged for commit to be committed.

* git diff will provide a summary of differences between the staging area and the last revision.

* to create an initial clone of the 'ld' repository (including the 'ld' subdirectory) into the current directory, perform:

    git clone https://talex1962@github.com/talex1962/ld.git

Then do

    git push -u origin master

and git push/pull will work without further ado.

* Creating a new Github repository around an existing directory tree:

1. Create the repository on Github using the web interface (see the '+' sign on the top right of the dashboard). Note the repository name as <repo name>.git.
2. Make sure that the top level of the directory tree is named the same as the repository name (for consistency).
3. Create an empty 'README.md' file in the top level of the directory tree:
	touch README.md
4. Initialize a Git repository at the top level of the directory tree and add the README.md file as its first (and only) contents:
	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "initializing repository"
5. Link the Github repository to the newly created local Git repository:
	git remote add origin https://github.com/talex1962/<repo name>.git
6. Push the newly created README.md file to the Github repository as the first contents:
	git push -u origin master
7. Edit the Git config file to configure the username; change:
	url = https://github.com/talex1962/<repo name>.git
   to:
	url = https://talex1962@github.com/talex1962/<repo name>.git
8. Add the remainder of the files within the directory tree to the local Git repository:
	git add <files and directories> (or just git add .)
9. Edit the README.md file and enter the details of the new repository.
10. Push the new collection of data and the updated README.md file to Github:
	git commit -a -m "Added directory contents to repository"
	git push origin

NOTE: for an existing Git local repository, omit steps 3 and 4.

* removing files & directories to be ignored from 'git status'

    1. Commit all pending changes first
    2. git rm --cached <file> or git rm -r --cached <directory>
    3. Commit again
    4. Add the file to .gitignore
    5. Check with git status and commit again
    6. git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>
